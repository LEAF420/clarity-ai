This document provides examples of Clarity's structured JSON responses with confidence levels and reasoning for transparency and trust.

## Text Processing Examples

### Example 1: Word-Finding Help

**Input:** "I'm having trouble finding the right word"

**Output:**
```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "text": "Try describing the object or concept using its features.",
      "confidence": "high",
      "reasoning": "Semantic feature analysis is an effective word-finding strategy."
    },
    {
      "text": "Take a moment to breathe and relax - stress can make word-finding harder.",
      "confidence": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Anxiety can interfere with language retrieval processes."
    },
    {
      "text": "Think of related words or synonyms that might help you find the right one.",
      "confidence": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Associative thinking can help access the target word through related concepts."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Social Anxiety Support

**Input:** "I feel anxious about my presentation tomorrow"

**Output:**
```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "text": "Practice your presentation out loud several times to build confidence.",
      "confidence": "high",
      "reasoning": "Repeated practice reduces anxiety and improves performance."
    },
    {
      "text": "Try deep breathing exercises before you start speaking.",
      "confidence": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Controlled breathing can help calm your nervous system."
    },
    {
      "text": "Remember that most people want you to succeed and are supportive.",
      "confidence": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Reframing the audience as supportive can reduce performance anxiety."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 3: Communication Skills

**Input:** "How should I respond when someone asks about my weekend?"

**Output:**
```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "text": "Share one specific activity you enjoyed, like 'I went hiking and saw a beautiful sunset.'",
      "confidence": "high",
      "reasoning": "Specific details make conversations more engaging and authentic."
    },
    {
      "text": "Ask them about their weekend too to keep the conversation flowing.",
      "confidence": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Reciprocal questions show interest and maintain conversation balance."
    },
    {
      "text": "If you had a quiet weekend, it's okay to say 'I had a relaxing weekend at home.'",
      "confidence": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Honest responses build genuine connections, even for simple activities."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Audio Processing Examples

### Example 1: Audio Transcription with Support

**Input:** Audio recording saying "I need help with communication"

**Output:**
```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "text": "I heard you say 'I need help with communication'. Try using 'I' statements to express your needs clearly.",
      "confidence": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Transcription appears clear but context may vary. 'I' statements are generally helpful for communication."
    },
    {
      "text": "Consider what specific aspect of communication you'd like to improve.",
      "confidence": "low",
      "reasoning": "Limited context from audio makes this a general suggestion."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Audio with Word-Finding Difficulty

**Input:** Audio recording saying "I can't find the word for... um... the thing that... you know..."

**Output:**
```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "text": "I heard you struggling to find a word. Try describing what the thing looks like or what it does.",
      "confidence": "high",
      "reasoning": "Clear audio shows word-finding difficulty. Feature description is an effective strategy."
    },
    {
      "text": "Take your time - it's okay to pause while you think of the right word.",
      "confidence": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Audio shows hesitation patterns typical of word-finding difficulties."
    }
  ]
}
```

      "reasoning": "Technical error occurred during processing"
    }
  ],
  "model": "gemma-3n-e2b-it"
}
```

### Example 2: Missing Fields

**Input:** "I need help"

**Model Response:** `{"suggestions": [{"text": "Try this approach"}]}`

**Error Handling:**
