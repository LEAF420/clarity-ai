I'm having trouble finding the right word for when you're really happy and excited about something.

I feel anxious about my presentation tomorrow. What should I do?

How do I respond when someone asks about my weekend?

I'm struggling to communicate with my family. Any suggestions?

What are some good conversation starters for meeting new people?

I need help organizing my thoughts before speaking.

How can I be more confident in social situations?

What should I do when I forget what I was going to say?

I want to improve my communication skills. Where do I start?

Can you help me find a word for when you're feeling overwhelmed but also grateful?
